# STAND-DEX

This is a project I created to learn the basics of building a full-stack web application. It acts as a wiki-type website (similar to the Poke-Dex for Pokemon) documenting the different Stands (pseudo-physical entities) featured in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, however custom Stands may be created as well.

* Front end in Angular 9 with Material Design components
* Back end with .NET Core
